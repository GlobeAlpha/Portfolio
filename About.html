                                                <p>My passion for all things computer didn't die I reignted the flame in '12 when I started my IT l2 course </p>
                                                <p>I got to say I was expecting bit more coding in this course however we barely learned basics of HTML/CSS.</p>
                                                <br />
                                                <p>This meant that if i wanted to complete my coursework I needed to learn more.</p>
                                                <p>Once upon a time i went to Library  to find a book the html ,low and behold I found it  in form of Head First 'HTML/CSS'.</p>
                                                <br  />
                                                <p>After this find I decided I am going to complete as many exercises as I possibly could, which allowed me to complete my webssite assigment.</p>
                                <div>
                                <br>
                                
                                <div>
                                <h4 style="color:white; font-size:16px;">Dedicated student ðŸŽ“ </h4>
                                
                                      <p>After leaving College in 2013  I decided to continue studying coding as I left College unsatified what I have learned</p>
                                      <p>I bought a couple of books most notable of whihc was "C++ in Easy Steps" by Mike Mcgrath which I bought with my Christmas money.</p>
                                      <br />
                                      <p>Somewhere alogn the line I realised that learning C++ wasn't  the best option for me as to my knowledge ahdnling events wasn't  as straight forward</p>
                                 <br />
                                 
                                      <p>Eventually I found freeCodeCamp a plaform whihc simplified learning  to code by making completly free and as it was a open soource project anyone could contribute.</p>
                                      <p>1 thing realised as I learned js is that handling events in js was very easy compared to C++ which encorured me to learn more .</p>
                                      <br />
                                
                                      <p>Despite my previous exposure to Html/Css I struggled intially with js  especially considering I didn't have a functioning laptop</p>
                                      <br />
                                      <p>Eventually when I got enough money together I got a tablet however  it wasn't the same as coding with laptop and even access that i had in library or borrwing a machine  limited my abillity to learn.</p>
                                        <br />
                                      <p> After 2 years of setbacks and constant challenges I manaeged to complete Front End Certification on freeCodeCamp with help of youtube.</p>

                                <p>During Late Spring 2018 and early summer I was attending  a lot  meetups </p>
                                <p>In course of those months I have met John Evans who  around June 2018 asked me if  i wanted  start a tech freelancers network with him.</p>
                                <br />
                                <p>This lead to me,John and Nick  spending next several months developing our bussiness plan.</p>
                                
                                </div>
