                    <h2><b>About me</b></h2>
                    <p>Hi its Maciek from before I am guessiing you're dying to find out more about me!</p>
                    <p>On work level  I can be bit pedatic  however once I get my  teeth or should i say beak inot a problem, you have to chase me away with a stick</p>
                    <p>Outside of my work I  like to think of ways to improve myself and my learning skills.</p>
                    <p> Funny story  how I got into Tech if you have time read my origin below</p>
                    
                    <p> As a child  my parents would often berate me to go to outside whihc apart from sandbox didn't realy interest me.</p>
                    <p>  Now you might wonder what kept me indoors ? Video games!</p>
                    <p>And this where I got my passion for  video game making  which I would rediscover later in life.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Fast forward to around 2012,I was finishing my Introduction to hair & beauty when I  rediscovered my passion for video game making  as i din't know what career I wanted to take </p>
                    <p> This lead me to start IT L2 which didn't teach me much  coding which is purpose behind my enrolement. </p>
                     <p> One of major disappoinments of that course was  the quality of our what college considered html lessons whihc was coloring text and creating links.</p>
                     <p> So  I took upon myself to find a book that would teach me more ,book I found was Head First Html/Css.</p>
                     <p> By no means was I master at Html  however this book helped me pass my assigment.</p>
                      <br />
                    
                      <p>As reality set in that I would have to do another course to learn to code I  spent whatever free time in college and outside  to learn C++.</p>
                      <p> At the time , 2013  resources for C++ weren't as great as they today so learning was bit of struggle.</p> 
                      <p> At some point I got a book  for learning C++ by easysteps.</p>

                      <p>This book  helped me learn C++ a lot faster than I would've without it.</p>
                      <p> Unfortunetly  I gave up on C++ for a lot reasons by main one was that handling events natively in C++ was quite complicated and C# wasn't appealing  for reason I won't go into now.</p>
                     
                      <p> This leads me to last 4 years.</p>
                      <p>During Spring 2016 , I found a self learning platform called freecodecamp as it turns out it was there since 2014.</p>
                      <p> This website helped me rediscover my html/css skills  and for first time ever I over came my fear  of JS.</p>
                    <br />
                      <p> Code Operative </p>
                      <p>  Around  Summer 2018 i attended  a meetup called "Tech4Good" run by John Evans in Campus North.</p>
                      <p>   Over Next  month or so  I would attend a lot of meetups including Tech Talent job fair.    </p>
                       <p>  Around  end of Summer 2018 , John Evans intruduced me to the idea of starting tech network being someone who wanted to  work in IT and being unemployed I jumped at the opportunity.</p>
                      <p>   Intially I didn't  understand what it was about I was just keen to be part of starting a company.</p>
                      <p>  Once I realised the idea was to create bussiness without all negatives nromally associated with workplace such as Nepotism. </p>
                    
                    <p> And this is my story so far  I hope that wasn't too long of a read  and you got enough information about me.</p>
